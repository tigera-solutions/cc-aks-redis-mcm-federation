# AKS cluster-mesh for Redis DB using Calico Cloud

## Welcome

In this AKS-focused workshop, you will learn how to implement Calico Cloud multi-cluster manangement and federation feature to achieve high availability for Redis database across multiple clusters. 

Calico Cloud federated endpoint identity and federated services are implemented in Kubernetes at the network layer. To apply fine-grained network policy between multiple clusters, the pod source and destination IPs must be preserved. So these features are valuable only if your clusters are designed with common networking across clusters with no encapsulation

Federated services works with federated endpoint identity, providing cross-cluster service discovery for a local cluster. Federated services use the Tigera Federated Services Controller to federate all Kubernetes endpoints (workload and host endpoints) across all of the clusters. The Federated Services Controller accesses service and endpoints data in the remote clusters directly through the Kubernetes API.

You will come away from this workshop with an understanding of how you can create a cluster-mesh to support high availability of applications running across multiple clusters, along with best practices you can implement in your organization.

### Time Requirements

The estimated time to complete this workshop is 75-120 minutes.

### Target Audience

- Cloud Professionals
- DevSecOps Professional
- Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)
- Solutions Architects
- Anyone interested in Calico Cloud :)

### Learning Objectives

1. Learn how to configure Calico Cloud federated endpoints across clusters.
2. Create federated services to provide high availability for your applicacion using multiple clusters.
